## **Key Insights from the Analysis**  

### **1. Total Wine Production in 2015 and 2018**  
- **2015**: **4,251.81**  
- **2018**: **4,039.32**  
- **Observation**: A **decline in wine production** between 2015 and 2018.  

### **2. Year with the Highest Stock Variation**  
- **2014 recorded the highest stock variation** with a total of **58,749.83**.  
- **Stock variation** reflects changes in food reserves, often influenced by factors such as **climate conditions, trade policies, and food security measures**.  

### **3. Total Protein Supply Quantity in Madagascar (2015)**  
- **173.05**  
- Indicates the **total amount of protein available for consumption** in Madagascar for the year **2015**.
